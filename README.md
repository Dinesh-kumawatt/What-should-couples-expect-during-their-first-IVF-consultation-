First IVF consultation is the starting point of your treatment journey. It can feel scary, but itâ€™s not painful or difficult.

During the visit, the doctor will first ask your history â€“ how long youâ€™ve been trying, if there were any miscarriages, your period cycle, and lifestyle. Then, you both will be advised some basic fertility tests â€“ AMH for women, semen analysis for men, maybe ultrasound or hormone tests.

Doctor will then explain the possible reasons for infertility and guide you on the best treatment â€“ whether you need IUI, IVF, or something else. They may also explain the steps of IVF: injections, egg collection, embryo transfer, etc.

You can also ask about success chances, side effects, cost, and how long the treatment takes. Donâ€™t be shy. Itâ€™s your body and your dream.

At Ayuh Fertility Centre, the first consultation is comfortable. Dr. Krupa Shah makes sure you feel relaxed. Her team listens patiently and gives honest advice, not forceful sales.
